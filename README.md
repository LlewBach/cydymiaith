## Overview

[Back to top](#milestone-3-project---cydymiaith)

Cydymiaith is a basic social network for Welsh language tutors and students to share information, practice and connect.

## UX

### Strategy

[Back to top](#milestone-3-project---cydymiaith)

This was inspired by my year as a Welsh language tutor for adult learners with learnwelsh.cymru. Rather than tutors communicating with students in an isolated manner via Whatsapp, I thought that a centralized platform would be more effective, more engaging and foster a greater sense of community.

Creator's goals...

- to create a platform for tutors and students to connect
- to provide a sense of community for learners
- to provide a means for learners to practice, find inspiration and learn from others
- to allow tutors to disseminate information more quickly and to allow students better visibility of news etc.

User's goals...

- to be able to communicate with class and tutor
- to have a place to practice reading and writing Welsh and have the opportunity to get feedback/corrections
- to be able to obtain answers from a larger base of expertise
- to connect with other speakers and learners
